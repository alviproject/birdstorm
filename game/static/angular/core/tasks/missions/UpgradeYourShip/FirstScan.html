            Go to <a ui-sref="map.system({system_id:1})">System 1</a> and select one of terrestrial planets, for example
            <a ui-sref="map.system.planet({system_id:1, planet_id:2})">this one</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then choose "Resources" tab in the details panel (it's next to "Planet" tab which is select by default).
        </p>

    <div ng-switch-when="scan">
        <p>
            Great! Now click "Scan" at the right of "Resources" tab.
        </p>
        <p>
            This operation will allow you to find out what kind of resources are located on the planet.

        <p>Well done!</p>

            Scanning operation takes some time, depending on planet type, deepness and your equipped scanner.
        </p>
        <p>
            Having a better scanner will also allow you to scan deeper and find more valuable resources, but we will get to this later.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now it's time to actually extract some resources.
