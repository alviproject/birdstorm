                    Very common planet composed mostly of silicate rocks or metals.<br />
                    Can be scanned and drilled using standard components. Usually contains easly extractable basic resources like Coal or Iron.

                <div ng-switch-when="GasGiant">
                    Gaseous planet consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium. Some heavier elements may occur as well, but they are extremely hard to extract.
                    <br />
                    Core of the planet is surrounded by metallic hydrogen which makes this place perfect for performing sophisticated experiments and producing rare materials.
